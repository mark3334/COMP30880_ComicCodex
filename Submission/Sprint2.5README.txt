# Sprint2_README File

## Overview
The **OpenAIClient** is the basic Java application that interfaces with the OpenAI API to provide an interactive chatbot experience. It maintains a conversation history, sends user prompts to the API, and retrieves responses from OpenAI's language model. Based on this functionality, we can input a file containing a large number of English phrases, translate it into our desired language, and use it for further development.

## Libraries
- org.json.JSONArray & org.json.JSONObject: JSONObject is used to create and parse JSON data and JSONArray processes JSON arrays.
- java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets: Set character encoding, used here for sending JSON request and reading API response.

## Features
- Communicates with OpenAI API via HTTP POST requests.
- Maintains a conversation history of up to 5 messages.
- Parses JSON responses to extract chatbot replies.
- Read a TSV file containing English text, translate it and output a file with the translations

## Structure
The Main class is the main class which runs the OpenAI class that is responsible for sending and receiving JSONobjects and creating and parsing them with strings. The client gets the api_key and other parameters from the config.txt file using the ConfigurationFile Class which has methods for getting value by key and creating a hashmap from the Config.txt file
SourceText is an entity class. The TSV file is read and stored into Java using the helper file, and finally, the translated file is output through the `TranslationManager` file.

## command line invocation:
To run the file do java -jar Sprint{the sprint number}executable.jar
Type in your prompt and type 'exit' to quit the program.
Place `words.tsv` in the project directory, and running the JAR file will output `translations.txt`.

## Noticeï¼š
- Avoid unnecessary keyboard input while waiting
- The .jar file must be in a folder called COMP30880_ComicCodex along with a Resources folder with Config.txt file and words.tsv
- OpenAI has a rate limit per minute - though we have an upgraded key now.
