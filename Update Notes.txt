For AudioIndex.java and TTStest.java
 - Merge the two classes into a single AudioManager class.
 - Merge the generateMp3File method into the getOrAdd method.
 - If the text doesn't exist, add it to indexes.txt and generate the MP3 file.
 - Delete TTStest.java File

For XML Parser.java
- Add addAudioToPanel method, it inserts <audio> tags into comic panels that contain dialogue or thought text. It links each <content> with corresponding TTS-generated audio files for source and target languages.

For Main.java
- Add the code needed for Sprint 6.
	- Step1: Use splitPanel to process the file.
	- Step2: Read the splitpanels file and use the getOrAdd method to create the indexes and audio files.
	- Step3: 

Some issues:
 - It seems like the file we generated in sprint 5 is being created twice. I manually modified the file to complete Sprint 6, but weâ€™ll need to optimize the code later.
